## Overview

### Scope and Goals

Dafka is a decentralize distributed streaming platform. What exactly does that
mean?

A streaming platform has three key capabilities:

    Publish and subscribe to streams of records, similar to a message queue or enterprise messaging system.
    Store streams of records in a fault-tolerant durable way.
    Process streams of records as they occur.

Dafka is generally used for two broad classes of applications:

    Building real-time streaming data pipelines that reliably get data between systems or applications
    Building real-time streaming applications that transform or react to the streams of data

To understand how Dafka does these things, let's dive in and explore Dafka's capabilities from the bottom up.

First a few concepts:

    Dafka is run as a cluster on one or more servers. The Dafka cluster stores
    streams of records in categories called topics. Each record consists of
    a arbitrary value. Producer and Consumer will communicate directly with each
    other. Missed events can be obtained either from the Producer or the
    Cluster.

### Ownership and License

Dafka uses the [C4.1 (Collective Code Construction Contract)](http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:22) process for contributions.

Dafka uses the [CLASS (C Language Style for Scalabilty)](http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:21) guide for code style.

## Using Dafka

### Building and Installing

To start with, you need at least these packages:

* {{git-all}} -- git is how we share code with other people.

* {{build-essential}}, {{libtool}}, {{pkg-config}} - the C compiler and related tools.

* {{autotools-dev}}, {{autoconf}}, {{automake}} - the GNU autoconf makefile generators.

* {{cmake}} - the CMake makefile generators (an alternative to autoconf).

Plus some others:

* {{uuid-dev}}, {{libpcre3-dev}} - utility libraries.

* {{valgrind}} - a useful tool for checking your code.

* {{pkg-config}} - an optional useful tool to make building with dependencies easier.

Which we install like this (using the Debian-style apt-get package manager):

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y \
        git-all build-essential libtool \
        pkg-config autotools-dev autoconf automake cmake \
        uuid-dev libpcre3-dev valgrind

    # only execute this next line if interested in updating the man pages as well (adds to build time):
    sudo apt-get install -y asciidoc

### Linking with an Application

Include `dafka.h` in your application and link with libdafka. Here is a typical gcc link command:

    gcc myapp.c -o myapp -ldafka -lczmq -lzmq

### API v1 Summary

This is the API provided by Dafka v1.x, in alphabetical order.

.pull doc/dafka_publisher.doc
.pull doc/dafka_store.doc
.pull doc/dafka_subscriber.doc
.pull doc/dafka_tower.doc

### Documentation

Man pages are generated from the class header and source files via the doc/mkman tool, and similar functionality in the gitdown tool (http://github.com/imatix/gitdown). The header file for a class must wrap its interface as follows (example is from include/zclock.h):

    //  @interface
    //  Sleep for a number of milliseconds
    void
        zclock_sleep (int msecs);

    //  Return current system clock as milliseconds
    int64_t
        zclock_time (void);

    //  Self test of this class
    int
        zclock_test (Bool verbose);
    //  @end

The source file for a class must provide documentation as follows:

    /*
    @header
    ...short explanation of class...
    @discuss
    ...longer discussion of how it works...
    @end
    */

The source file for a class then provides the self test example as follows:

    //  @selftest
    int64_t start = zclock_time ();
    zclock_sleep (10);
    assert ((zclock_time () - start) >= 10);
    //  @end

The template for man pages is in doc/mkman.

### Development

Dafka is developed through a test-driven process that guarantees no memory violations or leaks in the code:

* Modify a class or method.
* Update the test method for that class.
* Run the 'selftest' script, which uses the Valgrind memcheck tool.
* Repeat until perfect.

### Hints to Contributors

Don't include system headers in source files. The right place for these is dafka_prelude.h. If you need to check against configured libraries and/or headers, include platform.h in the source before including dafka.h.

Do read your code after you write it and ask, "Can I make this simpler?" We do use a nice minimalist and yet readable style. Learn it, adopt it, use it.
